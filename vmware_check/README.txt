This script is designed to be a Carbon Copy Cloner preflight script. I have a scheduled task that backs up ~/Documents/Virtual Machines/ each night, but if I have VMware open and a task running overnight, the backup eventually fills up the destination drive. This preflight script is designed to stop the backup if VMware Fusion is running.

Thanks:
