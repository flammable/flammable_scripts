flammable_scripts
=============

These are scripts that will hopefully be of use to other people (primarily, Mac sysadmins).

More resources available [at my blog](https://mikesolin.com).

## git_update
=======

This script is used for updating multiple Git repositories.

## imagesort
=======

Script to sort images into subfolders, based on resolution.

This script wouldn't have been possible without the help of everyone in [this Super User thread](http://superuser.com/questions/17562/how-to-sort-images-into-folders-based-on-resolution).

## update_packages
=======

This updates Homebrew, MacPorts, the az command, and pre-commit (if any of these are installed). Also, cleans up afterwards.
